# Docker files and Docker compose explorations

Learning to containerise stuff as I move machines & operating system often between work/home.

## Environment

Files in this folder will assume the following environment variables:
- `HOME`: path to user's home directory i.e. `/home/user/`
- `WORKSPACE`: path to general development workspace 
- `IDEA_WORKSPACE`: path to workspace for Intellij IDEA (Community)

## TODO list:
- Filesystem (zsh)
- Spacemacs
- Compose all the above
